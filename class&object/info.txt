*** The Difference between Objects & Data Structures / Container
  - Objects
    - Private internals / properties, public API (methods)
    - Contain your business login (in OOP)
    - Abstractions over concretions
  
  - Data Structures / Container
    - Public internals / properties, (almost) no API (methods)
    - Store and transport data
    - Concretions only
 
- POLYMORPHISM - The ability of an object to take on many forms
  - It is simply an object or a method, which always has the same structure and the same name, but which then does different things

- Classes
  - Should be small
    - Classes should have a single responsibility (Single-Responsibility Principle --> SRP)
