Method is just a function inside object

- Calling the function should be readable
  - The number and order of arguments matters

- Working with the function should be easy / readable
  - The length of the function body matters

*** Minimize the number of parameters
  - None - best possible option - not always possible
  - 1 - very good possible option
  - 2 - use with caution
  - 3 - avoid if possible
  - >3 - always avoid

*** Functions Should be small
  - Functions Should Do Exactly One Thing
    - Different Operations
      - Validate + Save User Input
    - Different Levels of Abstraction
      - High Level
        - function which has a descriptive name and then does something
        - isEmail()
      - Low Level
        - low level API method / operation
        - includes()
    
    - Try not to mix multiple levels of abstraction in one of the same function
